# etch-a-sketch

This is a simple sketch/drawing pad I made for the etch-a-sketch assignment from
[The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

The idea was to practice JavaScript and DOM manipulation so my markup is the h1
element and a div "container" and that's it.
I used JavaScript for everything else -- creating the buttons, the grid of divs
which is the drawing pad, etc.

The assignment said to ask the user, via prompt, to enter a number for how many divs
to resize the grid and start with a 16x16 grid.

I wanted to do it a different way (I don't like the prompt or alert boxes)
so I used buttons which the user can press in order to increase or decrease the
density of the divs inside the container, the drawing surface. So like for instance
you'd push the button a bunch of times to get a 60x60 grid of the same width and height.

I used pointer events, instead of mouse events. I'd like to get it working on mobile.

This assignment was hard for me and I had to search for examples and reach out for help
but I know my JavaScript skills have improved since I started this.

I'll probably refactor and tweak the code some more but I'm putting it up on GitHub pages.
